# Bias-detect
# 🧠 Bias Detector

This project, **Bias Detector**, was created in **Google Colab** as part of an AI Ethics and Bias Awareness exercise. It helps analyze datasets for **potential bias and unfairness** in predictions or attributes.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

AI models can unintentionally learn and reproduce biases found in training data. The **Bias Detector** aims to detect, visualize, and reduce such biases using a fairness auditing approach.

The notebook walks through:

1. Uploading and loading data (CSV format)
2. Exploring key variables and target columns
3. Checking representation of protected attributes (e.g., gender, race, age)
4. Running bias metrics to detect unfair patterns
5. Visualizing and interpreting bias findings

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python 3**
* **Google Colab**
* **Pandas** – data cleaning and manipulation
* **NumPy** – numerical computations
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – optional model evaluation tools

---

## 📂 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** (`Bias detector.ipynb`).
2. Upload your dataset (CSV file) when prompted.
3. Ensure your dataset includes:

   * **Target variable** (e.g., model prediction or decision)
   * **Protected attributes** (e.g., gender, race, or age)
4. Follow the code cells step-by-step.
5. The notebook will generate bias analysis reports and charts.

## 🧩 Example Outputs

* Bias metrics by group (e.g., accuracy difference by gender)
* Visualizations showing representation and fairness
* Summary of which groups may be under- or over-represented

---

## 📊 Interpretation

Use the bias results to:

* Identify **disparities** in model outcomes
* Recommend **data balancing** or **model adjustments**
* Understand the ethical implications of using AI in decision-making

---

## 💡 Key Learning Outcomes

* Understanding **AI fairness concepts**
* Hands-on experience with **bias detection tools**
* Improving awareness of ethical AI practices
